# Scooter app

The objective of this app is to compare diverse means of transport in comparison to 
a scooter selection for your daily life (i.e. to commute to work) 
in terms of involved energy demand, fuel/electricity cost, economic savings and CO2 emissions.

 'Main_scooter.py' should be run to open and use the Scooter application.
 The graphical user interface "GUI_Scooter.ui" is designed and built by QT Designer software.
 
Firstly, the main trip characteristics are depicted. They can be modified by the user, such as 
  - the trip distance, 
  - the number of trips,
  - months of current usage, 
  - the evaluation horizon to carry out the comparison
  - etc.

Secondly, the main features of scooter are selected, such as 
 - capital and maintenance costs,
 - nominal battery capacity, 
 - electricity cost per kWh
 - electricity consumption of the scooter
 - charger efficiency
 - GHG emissions
 - etc.

Thirdly, the base case should be selected (bus, fuel-based car or electric car) and characterized
 - ticket price or operating costs
 - fuel or electricity consumption
 - occupance
 - GHG emissions
 - etc.
 
Finally, the main results are depicted:
 - Full Equivalent Cycles
 - Electricity demand and cost
 - Charging cost per cycle
 - GHG emissions
 - Base Case results
 - Comparison at current stage: 
    * Economic and GHG savings
 - Comparison at the evaluation horizon
    * Full Equivalent cycles
    * Electricity demand
    * Economic savings
    * GHG savings
 
 
 Available for information purposes and personal use only.
 
 This python app and code is my first project in Python environment.
